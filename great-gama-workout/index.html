The Great Gama performing hindu pushups. This man successfully lifted From pinterest.com
You’re working your upper as well as your lower body in a single movement. By the looks of it, his mustache also trained with a gada. All this workout built up quite an appetite, he ate 6 desi chicken, drank 10 liters of milk, half a liter of lassi, six pounds of butter, three buckets of fruit chaat along with fruit juices, and a special tonic made of almonds added to his strength. Gym exercises are stupid and easy and less painful while high rep bodyweight workout is more difficult.
