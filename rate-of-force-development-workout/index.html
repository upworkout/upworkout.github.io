Rate of Force Development Series YouTube From youtube.com
We can speculate that the discrepancy between the 2 studies might be because of the differences in the exercise used for the evaluation of rfd: Since maximum force cannot be developed with fast movements, any increase in the rate of force developed in the early phase of contraction becomes vital. If you’re not quite there yet, your priority should be to get stronger by sticking with. This blog will cover the different physiological components, training methodologies, and proper sequencing of training when developing an athlete’s rate of force development (rfd).

While how quickly this weight is moved does relate to our overall strength, how quickly we can apply this strength plays a big role in our rate of force development. Rate of force development and impulse were increased between t1 and t2 in all time frames (figures 1a, b and table 2).

The rate of force development (rfd) is an essential component for performance in explosive activities, although it has been proposed that muscle architectural characteristics might be linked with rfd and power performance. Since maximum force cannot be developed with fast movements, any increase in the rate of force developed in the early phase of contraction becomes vital. Well to have a rapid increase in force it is best to start at zero.</p>
