Barbell Clean and Press to Rollout to Pushup Video Watch Proper Form From muscleandfitness.com
Forward under bar so that it’s now positioned across the front of the shoulders. The clean and press, commonly known as a barbell clean and press, is a compound workout that works all of your muscles. As the weights pass knee level, shrug your shoulders hard, squeeze your glutes again, and allow the momentum to carry the dumbbells up in front of you. Once the barbell rests in front of your shoulders, pause briefly before driving the weight up and above your head.
