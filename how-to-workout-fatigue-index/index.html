Mean exercise intensity and fatigue index following separate arm and From researchgate.net
Muscle physiologists often have previously described fatigue as a decline in muscular force due to exercise [1]. The fatigue index is found by taking the minimum power away from the maximal power and then dividing by the total time for the sprints; For example, if the times for the first three sprints were 6.9, 7.1, and 6.7 (average 6.9 seconds) and the last three times were 7.6, 8.2, and 7.9 (average 7.9 seconds), the fatigue. While exercise is a common cause of muscle fatigue, this symptom can be the result of other health.
